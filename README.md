TunnelingRecursiveRouter
========================

TRR handles situations where extreme complex network solution is required. It builds an infrastructure of multilevel encapsulated networks that gives a transparent bidirectional VPN-like connectivity where different nodes are located in tightly locked down secure environments. It will support TCP and UDP over IPv4 and IPv6, and optionally all other protocol using raw packets. 

TRR is dual-license. For general use it is GPL v2, and if requested and conditions are approved, TRR can be Apache License 2.0.
